# django-audiophile
Learning project with Django (Python) and NextJs. A dockerized application for the Front End Mentor challenge called Audiophile. The objective for me is to integrate all these tools and deploy the application when ready. Part of the front end is ready in another repository called "audiophile" altough there is a long way to go.
