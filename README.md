# django-audiophile
Learning project with Django (Python) and NextJs. A dockerized application for the Front End Mentor challenge called Audiophile. The objective for me is to integrate all these tools and deploy the application when ready. There is a basic configuration for the Django aplication and part of the front end is done, altough there is a long way to go.
